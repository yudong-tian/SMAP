Files are named according to the following convention, which is described in Table 1:
SMAP_L1C_TB_[Orbit#]_[A/D]_yyyymmddThhmmss_RLVvvv_NNN.[ext]

For example:

SMAP_L1C_TB_03895_D_20151024T213750_R11920_001.h5

Where:

Table 1. File Naming Conventions
Variable	Description
SMAP	Indicates SMAP mission data
L1C_TB	Indicates specific product (L1C: Level-1C; TB: Brightness Temperature)
[Orbit#]	5-digit sequential number of the orbit flown by the SMAP spacecraft when data were acquired. Orbit 00000 began at launch.
[A/D]	Half-orbit pass of the satellite, such as: 
A: Ascending (where satellite moves from South to North, and 6:00 p.m. is the local solar equator crossing time)
D: Descending (where satellite moves from North to South, and 6:00 a.m. is the local solar equator crossing time)
yyyymmddThhmmss	Date/time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) of the first data element that appears in the product, where:
yyyymmdd	4-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day
T	Time (delineates the date from the time, i.e. yyyymmddThhmmss)
hhmmss	2-digit hour, 2-digit month, 2-digit second
RLVvvv	Composite Release ID, where:
R	Release
L	Launch Indicator (1: Post-launch standard data)
V	1-Digit Major Version Number
vvv	3-Digit Minor Version Number
Example: R14001 indicates a a standard data product with a version of 4.001.
NNN	Number of times the file was generated under the same version for a particular date/time interval (002: 2nd time)
.[ext]	File extensions include:
.h5	HDF5 data file
.qa	Quality Assurance file
.xml	XML Metadata file
